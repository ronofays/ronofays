👋 Hi, I’m @ronofays

💬 I like digging into technology for the joy of discovering how things work. In particular, I am super interested in devoloping software tools that provide superpower-like learning abilities for humans. Anki is an inspiring project for me, and I am fascinated by the idea of applying spaced repetition to devoloping procederal memory.
